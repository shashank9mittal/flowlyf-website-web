                                While in normal subscription, you choose to subscribe to a product, extend its usage

                                return it when you are done.

                                We add another level of flexibility for our customers to opt for Subscribe -to- Own,

                                with subscription, and you can opt to own the product whenever you please.

                                Just pay the difference of the Adjusted Buying Price and the subscription you have
                                paid

                                own it, simple. Let us walk you through an example-

                                Suppose you Subscribed to the FlowDesk at Rs. 2000/month. After 6 months of the
                                subscription
                                duration, you decide to own it. By this time, you must have already paid Rs. 2,000*6
                                =
                                Rs.
                                12,000.
                                And the Adjusted Buying Price is Rs.30000.

                                Now, Rs. 30,000 - Rs. 12,000 = Rs. 18,000. All you have to do is pay the price, i.e.
                                Rs.
                                18,000, and
                                the FlowDesk is yours!

                                On every product page, you can see the predefined Subscribe -to- Own prices. Decide
                                if
