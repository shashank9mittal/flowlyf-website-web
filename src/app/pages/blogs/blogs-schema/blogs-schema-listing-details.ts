You get to skip the daily dread of the commute, have a certain degree of flexibility into your schedule, and get to spend more time with the family. However, remote working has not been a lifestyle choice but a norm in recent times. For countless individuals, it is an entirely new experience that they are coming to terms with. And regardless of how new or old you are to this mode, a sedentary lifestyle is bad news for all. 
                How is your body and mind dealing with the new normal? Have you been keeping a check on your health and activity during these times? Here are some ways to ensure a fit and active routine while working from home:`

When burdened by a busy workload, you tend to sit for as long as possible just to get done with your tasks for the day. However, before you realize, hours seem to have gone by with you not having moved an inch away from your chair. To avoid that from happening, you should take regular breaks during the day just to get out of your chair and move around a little. Be it to make yourself a cup of tea, hold a call, or have a conversation with a family member; leave your deskspace at least once in an hour to stretch, relax, and refresh your body and mind.`

For instance, many people feel comfortable exercising during the morning hours before they start their day while for others, it is an evening activity after they are done for the day. Choose the time as per your convenience but do not skip exercising or at least some warm-up workouts.`

For instance, you can create a quiet space to reflect and to journal, designate specific time for your work, fitness, family time etc., and to mentally separate the parts of your day.

        Solace is good, as it gives an opportunity to reflect, plan, and relax without external interruptions. We are quick to state how we do not have time for ourselves, but one of the silver lines to this pandemic is being bestowed with the same. You can use this time to recharge yourself by allocating an hour or two each day to walk, exercise, read, or do something that does not involve others. Instead of searching for ways to fill your time and space, you may as well value the time you have alone and make use of it to introspect and heal!
